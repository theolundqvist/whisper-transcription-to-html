# whisper-transcription-to-html
A python script that reformats whisper transcriptions (text with timestamp) to a readable format in html with convenient play buttons on each row to listen to the recording at that time.



## Requirements
 - Python3
 - (please notify me if anything else is needed so that I can add it to this README)

## How to use
1. Place your `transcription.txt` in the folder called `in/`
2. Place your audio-file called `transcription.m4a` in the folder `out/audio/`
3. Run `python format.py`
4. A zip called `out.zip` will be created, which is ready for export
